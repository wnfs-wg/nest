## Features

- A file system class that allows for an easy-to-use mutable API.
- A root tree, holding references to all the needed individual parts (public fs, private forest, exchange, etc)
- A unix-fs compatibility layer for the public file system (allows for public files to be viewed through, for example, IPFS gateways)
- A mounting system for private nodes, mount specific paths.
- Provides a transaction system, rewinding the state if an error occurs.
- Creates a private forest automatically with a RSA modules using the Web Crypto API (supported on multiple platforms)
- Ability to verify commits to the file system. If a commit, aka. modification, is not verified, it will result in a no-op.
- And more: typed paths, events, path helpers, data casting, â€¦
